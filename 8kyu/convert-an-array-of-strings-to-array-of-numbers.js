// ❓Description:

// Oh no!
// Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!
// You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.
// Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

// ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]

// Note that you can receive floats as well.

// ✅Solution:

//version 1
function toNumberArray(stringarray) {
    for (let i = 0; i < stringarray.length; i++) {
        stringarray[i] = Number(stringarray[i])
    }
    return stringarray
}

console.log(toNumberArray(["1", "2", "3"]));


//version 2
